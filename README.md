During pentesting I often miss screenshots of events for reports due to the quick pace of testing and a lack of foreknowledge about what will be important. To remedy that problem (and also to teach myself go) I built a command line tool that implements the "clip that" functionality of gaming consoles to allow me to save the last minute of screen activity as images to later view.
